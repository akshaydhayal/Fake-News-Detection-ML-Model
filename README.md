# Fake-News-Detection-ML-Model
* Developed a Machine Learning Model which Classifies News and Articles into Fake and legitimate News.
* The Model is a hybrid Neural Network of Convolutional Neural and Recurrent Neural Network where CNN extracts local features and RNN uses local features by CNN and learns the long-term dependencies of local features to predict
* Executed using TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and Numpy libraries on Google Collab Environment
